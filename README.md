# OriginalBrawl.js
First open-source Brawl Stars v2.57 JavaScript server! Based on [nodebrawl-core](https://github.com/tailsjs/nodebrawl-core)

* [Русский язык](/README-ru.md)

## Requirements
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* Brain

## Setting up
1. Download/clone a repository
2. Type in console `npm install`
3. `node index`

## How to play?
To play you need IPA client of Brawl Stars v2.57. You can download it anywhere, i guess.<br>

Then you need to somehow redirect yourself from `game.brawlstarsgame.com` to your IP.<br>

My method is simply to change the `hosts` file in `/etc/hosts`. **NEEDS JAILBREAK**<br>

Just add `YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE game.brawlstarsgame.com` to the end of the file.

## What's working?
* Battles *(NEED TO PLAY THROUGH BOT BATTLE)*
* Home *(OwnHomeData without HEX)*
* Player Profile.
* Club and Chat
* Leaderboards

## Credits
* Depresive Primo for helping with some structures.
* Ultracore for OHD HEX structure
