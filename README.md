# OriginalBrawl.js
First open-source Brawl Stars v2.57 JavaScript server! Based on [nodebrawl-core](https://github.com/tailsjs/nodebrawl-core)

## Setting up
1. Download/clone a repository
2. Type in console `npm install`
3. `node index`

## How to play?
To play you need IPA client of Brawl Stars v2.57. You can download it anywhere, i guess.<br>
Then you need to somehow redirect yourself from `game.brawlstarsgame.com` to your IP.<br>
My method is simply to change the `hosts` file in `/etc/hosts`. **NEEDS JAILBREAK**<br>
Just add `YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE game.brawlstarsgame.com` to the end of the file.

## What's working?
* Battles *(NEED TO PLAY THROUGH BOT BATTLE)*
* Home *(OwnHomeData without HEX)*
* Player Profile.
